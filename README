1 - OVERVIEW
The convex hull is the smallest convex set of points that contains all points.
The easiest way to think of it is like a rubber band stretched over a peg board.
This application visually shows how the convex hull is calculated, currently implemented
using Andrew's monotone chain algorithm O(n log n).  The source code for this
implementation is included in the file convexHull.py.

2 - USAGE
Open the command line (unix) or command prompt (windows).  Navigate to the launch.py file
and enter the command 'python launch.py'. A graphical environment is shown and accepts
mouse clicks to make points to calculate the convex hull on.  At any point in time, if
'Get Hull' is clicked then the points that constitute the convex hull are colored red as
well as the edges connecting them.


3 - TODO
-Interactive environment, where each step of the convex hull is shown visually
-Implement other Convex Hull algorithms to analyse
